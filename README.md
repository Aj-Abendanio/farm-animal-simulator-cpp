# farm-animal-simulator-cpp
A console based C++ game where you take care of different farm animals

**Status:** Work in Progress  
Currently developing the game’s main body, animal selection, and health system.

## Features (so far)
- Game intro with serious and unserious Terms of Agreement
- Input validation for nickname and Y/N responses
- Smooth text animation and loading sequence (i think)
- Next: Animal selection and randomized events
